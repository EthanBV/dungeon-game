				+ "and those who don't aren't likely to survive for long. The health potion comes in a standered potion glass designed for a single use; the entirety of the liquid can be "
				+ "swallowed in one or two gulps. Some speculate that the reason this glass is used for the majority of potions is because it was first used only for this ubiquitous "
				+ "elixir, but empty bottles were used by herbalists for storing other potions.\n\nHealth potions work extremely quickly. As soon as the liquid is consumed, wounds and "
				+ "injuries begin closing and the users vitality begins to restore. However, the high is short lived, as after just a few seconds the healing effect wears off. On top of "
				+ "the healing, these potions provide an exilerating feeling, which is as quick to impact and receed as the healing itself. Many users have become addicted to this feeling, "
				+ "and will consume a potion even when in good health, just for the high provided. As such, care must be taken in the use of these potions, or addiction may develop.\n\n"
				+ "Because of their popularity, health potions are one of the few potions that can be bought from merchants other than herbalists. Traveling merchants always have a few, "
				+ "but always keep a few for themselves, and the nature of their job means they will often find themselves with otherwise life threatening injuries. General merchants "
				+ "will usually have a stockpile, because of the nearly guaranteed profit they provide. Herbalists sell them cheaply, and the recipe for one is one of the easiest to "
				+ "learn. Despite how common these red bottles are in villages and towns, they are nearly impossible to find in the below, as anyone holding one would have used it before "
				+ "meeting their demise.\n\n\"Ever wonder what's in a health potion?\" -Tankin, the first herbalist";
